Part 1:-
--------
37 AD, Rome
Caligula was greeted with great eagerness at the time of his accession as emperor. Six months into his reign, the people considered him a noble emperor. But soon after, his true nature began to assert itself once he felt securely in charge. He became erratic and cruel. His depravity and narcissism knew no bounds. He forced his fellow potential rival to commit suicide. He terrorized and humiliated members of the Senate. He committed incest with his sisters. He had protesting Roman citizens murdered and publicly tortured for his pleasure. The Senate grew restless and conspired against him.
